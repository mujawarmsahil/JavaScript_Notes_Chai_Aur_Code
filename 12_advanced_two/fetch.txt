It is a feature of node.js 
It is a method starts the process of fetching a resource from the network , returning a promise which is fulfilled once the response is available.

Interview question
Question -> Suppose we request using promise and gives 404 error then where it will come? in reject or resolve ?
Answer -> It always comes in resolve because its a response .Reject means we failed to request but in this case we requested but from there we get response as 404 error


High priority queue is also known as micro task queue / fetch queue / priority queue


How the fetch works ?

response = fetch('address');

this fetch further divide into 2 parts 
1. data :- means the responses are stored in this section.This is a private field we cannot put or remove data in it or from it
 data : 
    onFulfilled[]
    onRejection[]

There are two arrays in data which are not accessible to developers to push data in it 
After getting response the data is automatically pushed in either onFulfilled or onRejection as per the response.

2.web browser API / node API
In this the network request is sent to resource then the response either it rejected or responded pushed in the arrays of data section.

further its responsibility of data to give the response for the global context
