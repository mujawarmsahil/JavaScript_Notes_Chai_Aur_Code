Javascript is a by default synchronous and single threaded language
We have some exception but this is used when we needed
Single threaded means stop further work until current complete work

    Blocking code                                Non-Blocking code
      (sync)                                          (async)  

Block the flow of diagram                        does not block the execution
example :- Read file sync                         read file async
wait as it is until I complete my work          Do your work until i am doing my work later i will join you

Both are good .We can use both codes as per the use-case
Blocking code :- registering the user (wait until i check and store data in database)
